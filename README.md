## 🎯 What is Codev?

Codev is a **Python-based AI Agent Automation framework** designed to help developers build intelligent agents that can:

- 🤖 **Accept tasks** via CLI or web interface
- 🔧 **Auto-select tools** (search, code generation, documentation APIs)
- ⚡ **Execute autonomously** with real-time logging and progress tracking
- 🌐 **Integrate seamlessly** with multiple APIs and services
- 📊 **Track performance** with built-in analytics

Built by [VinodHatti7019](https://github.com/VinodHatti7019), Codev is more than a framework—it's a **community-driven playground** for AI innovation.
